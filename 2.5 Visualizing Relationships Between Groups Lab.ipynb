    "You are part of a data team for a financial institution that uses an AI model to determine who will and will not be granted a loan.  Recently, there have been complaints from customers that the model unfairly discriminates based on the applicant's age and sex. A court has ordered that the financial institution must provide information about how the model works.  \n",
