    "For your lab submission, describe the dataset and the features - including all of the values of the features - and identify the target feature.  Then make visualizations to show the relationship of each feature to the target.  Which feature(s) seem most related?  Which features don't seem to influence the value of the target?  Draw at least one big picture conclusion about your data from the visualizations you've created.\n"
